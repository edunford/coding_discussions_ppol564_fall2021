    "A naive Bayes classifier that predicts whether or not a person voted based on discrete outcome contained in the dataset was created. The discrete variable was whether or not a person was white. The classifier is based on an assumption that each variable is independent of the others in the model. Class probabilities were calculated; the probability that someone voted was 0.739375 and the probability that someone did not vote was 0.260625. Conditional probabilities were calculated for each class; whether or not a person was white given that they did or did not vote.\n",

When run on the training data, the classifer was accurate approximately 75% of the time. When run on the test data, the classifer was accurate approximately 70% of the time, which was slightly less accurate than the training data, as expected. However, the classifer worked much better than a coin flip."

    "## Part 2: Continuous Variables\n",
    "A naive Bayes classifier that predicts whether or not a person voted based on the continuous variables in the dataset (age, education level, income) was created. Again, the classifier is based on an assumption that each variable is independent of the others in the model. Class probabilities calculated above were used; the probability that someone voted was 0.739375 and the probability that someone did not vote was 0.260625. The probability density function for the normal distribution was used to convert the continuous variables into probabilities. The conditional means and standard deviations were calculated for each value of the outcomes. These were then used to calculate predictions for all observations in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probabilities were multiplied together for each outcome to predict whether a given person would vote. This was done for each observation in the data. When run on the training data, the classifer was accurate approximately 75% of the time. When run on the test data, the classifer was accurate approximately 72% of the time, which was slightly less accurate than the training data, as expected. However, the classifer worked much better than a coin flip."
